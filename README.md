# Optimized Dynamic Programming-Based Algorithms Solver (OptimizedDP)
The repo contains implementation of dynamic programming based algorithms in optimal control. Specifically, the solver supports 3 main classes of algorithms: level set based algorithm for solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Issac (HJI) partial differential equation (PDE) arising in reachability analysis and differential games [1], time-to-reach (TTR) computations of dynamical systems in reachability analysis [2], and value-iterations algorithm for solving continuous state-space action-space Markov Decision Process (MDP). All these algorithms share the property of being implemented on a multidimensional grid and hence, their computational complexities increase exponentially as a function of dimension. For all the aforementioned algorithms, our toolbox allows computation up to 6 dimensions, which we think is the limit of dynammic programming on most modern personal computers.

In comparison with previous works, our toolbox strives to be both efficient in implementation while being user-friendly. This is reflected in our choice of having Python as a language for initializing problems and having python-like HeteroCL [3] language for the core algorithms implementation and dynamical systems specification. Our implementation is 7-32x faster than the [Level Set Toolbox](https://github.com/risk-sensitive-reachability/ToolboxLS) and [HelperOC](https://github.com/HJReachability/helperOC) and 2-3x faster than [BEACLS](https://hjreachability.github.io/beacls/) implementation in C++. Please find more details about using the repo for solving your problems in this page, and should you have any questions/problems/requests please direct the messages to Minh Bui at buiminhb@sfu.ca 

# Quickstart (Ubuntu 18, 20, 22)

# Solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Issac (HJI) PDE
* We provide a running example of solving HJI PDE in the file [`examples/plotting_example.py`](https://github.com/SFU-MARS/optimized_dp/examples/examples.py):
```python
# STEP 1: Define grid
grid_min = np.array([-4.0, -4.0, -math.pi])
grid_max = np.array([4.0, 4.0, math.pi])
dims = 3
N = np.array([150, 150, 150])
pd=[2]
g = Grid(grid_min, grid_max, dims, N, pd)

# STEP 2: Generate initial values for grid using shape functions
center = np.zeros(dims)
radius = 1.0
ignore_dims = [2]
Initial_value_f = CylinderShape(g, ignore_dims, center, radius)

# STEP 3: Time length for computations
Lookback_length = 1.0
t_step = 0.05

small_number = 1e-5
tau = np.arange(start=0, stop=Lookback_length + small_number, step=t_step)

# STEP 4: System dynamics for computation
sys = DubinsCapture(uMode="max", dMode="min")

# STEP 5: Initialize plotting option
po1 = PlotOptions(do_plot=False, plot_type="set", plotDims=[0,1,2])

# STEP 6: Call HJSolver function
compMethod = { "TargetSetMode": "None"}
result_3 = HJSolver(sys, g, Initial_value_f, tau, compMethod, po1, saveAllTimeSteps=True)
```
* To run the example, execute the command `python3 examples/plotting_example.py`
* If the parameter `do_plot` is set to `True`, when initializing `PlotOptions`. The parameter `saveAllTimeSteps` is set to `False` in `HJSolver`, an static 3D plot will show on pop-up browser.

</div>        

* If interactive 3D animation needs to be visualized, and outputs need to be saved locally
```python
# While file needs to be saved locally, set save_fig=True and filename, recommend to set interactive_html=True for better visualization
po2 = PlotOptions(do_plot=False, plot_type="set", plotDims=[0,1,2],
                  slicesCut=[1], colorscale="Bluered", save_fig=True, filename="plots/3D_0_sublevel_set", interactive_html=True)

# STEP 6: Call Plotting function
plot_isosurface(g, result_3, po2)
```

<!-- * Check the interactive result [`images/3D_0_sublevel_set.html`](https://github.com/SFU-MARS/optimized_dp/images/3D_0_sublevel_set.html) -->


* For computing result higher than 6D, check [`examples/examples.py`](https://github.com/SFU-MARS/optimized_dp/examples/examples.py)
* Notes: For 6 dimensions, recommended grid size is 20-30 each dimension on system with 32Gbs of DRAM.
* Create a class file in folder dynamics/ to specify your own system dynamics. Remember to import the class in your running example.  

## System dynamics specification
It can noticed in ```user_definer.py``` that the class DubinsCapture is imported from the folder ```dynamics/```, where our example system dynamics. 
```python 
import heterocl as hcl

class DubinsCapture:
    def __init__(self, x=[0,0,0], wMax=1.0, speed=1.0, dMax=1.0, uMode="max", dMode="min"):
        self.x = x
        (...)
        self.dMode = dMode

    def opt_ctrl(self, t, state, spat_deriv):
        """
                :param  spat_deriv: tuple of spatial derivative in all dimensions
                        state: x1, x2, x3
                        t: time
                :return: a tuple of optimal disturbances
        """

        (...)
        return (opt_w[0], in3[0], in4[0])

    def opt_dstb(self, t, state, spat_deriv):
        """
            :param spat_deriv: tuple of spatial derivative in all dimensions
                    state: x1, x2, x3
                    t: time
            :return: a tuple of optimal disturbances
        """
        (...)        
        return (d1[0], d2[0], d3[0])

    def dynamics(self, t, state, uOpt, dOpt):
        (...)
        return (x_dot[0], y_dot[0], theta_dot[0])
``` 


# Time-to-Reach computation
* We have provided an example in [`examples/TTR_example.py`](https://github.com/SFU-MARS/optimized_dp/examples/TTR_example.py):
```python
# -------------------------------- ONE-SHOT TTR COMPUTATION ---------------------------------- #
g = Grid(minBounds=np.array([-3.0, -1.0, -math.pi]), maxBounds=np.array([3.0, 4.0, math.pi]),
         dims=3, pts_each_dim=np.array([50, 50, 50]), periodicDims=[2])
# Car is trying to reach the target
my_car = DubinsCar(uMode="min")

# Initialize target set as a cylinder
targetSet = CylinderShape(g, [2], np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0]), 0.70)
po = PlotOptions( "3d_plot", plotDims=[0,1,2], slicesCut=[],
                  min_isosurface=lookback_length, max_isosurface=lookback_length)

# Convergence threshold
epsilon = 0.001
V_0 = TTRSolver(my_car, g, targetSet, epsilon, po)
```
* To run the example : `python3 TTR_example.py`
# Current code structure
* solver.py: Containing python APIs to interact with the numerical solver
* dynamics/ : User's dynamical system specification
* Shapes/ShapesFunctions.py : Add-in functions for initializing different shapes/intial value functions
* computeGraphs/CustomGraphFunctions.py: Ready-to-user HeteroCL style utility functions
